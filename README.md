The Continuous Time Markov Chain Model (CTMC) Parasite Life Cycle Project 

Incorporating Rust, Python3, and MATLAB/OCTAVE, code along with parralelization and continuous integration frameworks to create a comprehensive program for modelling the plasmodium falcifiparum (malaria parasite) life cycle. Only the basic example user interface code (Rust, Python3, Shiny for Python) is currently public. 

Here is example output from the Gillespie SSA basic SIR modelimplmeneted with parallel processing (100 simulations) in Rust.
